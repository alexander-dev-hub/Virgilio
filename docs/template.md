This file contains a generic template for a guide about some subject X.

Please remember to:
 - be consistent throughout the guide.
 - be as clear as possible.
 - write in your best English.
 - include examples whenever possible.
 - use internal links for easier navigation; an internal link to a section can be made by using the `#` sign, followed by the section name, with hyphens `-` instead of spaces (so section "Who am I" can be referenced with `#who-am-i`).
 - provide relevant links if you list some prerequisites.
 - provide a small challenge each step of the guide, it's too easy and not effective to just walk around among topics!
