# Mathematics

This document serves two main purposes:

 1. First, an attempt to be a comprehensive listing of the mathematical topics that show up quite often in fields such as computer science, data science, machine learning, etc.
 2. Second, to provide references where the readers can learn (for free) about these topics; these references can be for online resources or for books.
 
## Layout of this document

If you are reading this document and looking for a specific topic, my suggestion would be that you use your browser's "search" capabilities (usually you can do this by pressing `CTRL + F`) and type in whatever you want to learn about. Hopefully, that will be written down somewhere in the document.

The document will have an index, but I will try to keep it somewhat high-level, so that very specific things probably won't show up there. In the document itself, close to a topic, I will list related words or search terms that my have to do with that topic.
